RTraderGame
===========

This game is basically an experiment as I am learning Ruby. I've always been hooked on economical games, buying and selling goods. It seemed like such a simple idea and could be done with easily extensible code. So this is my new side project. I'm sure if you were to look back through the commits once I'm done, you'll see a lot of growth. Anyway, keep an eye out for updated code!

Also feel free to comment or contribute!
